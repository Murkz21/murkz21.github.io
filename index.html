      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Eestimation of the Bitcoin Value and Price (updated 2020-11-13):</p>
      <img src="Estimation 20201113.jpg">
      <p>
        PS:\n
        This estimation is based on generalized Metcalfe's Law and ecological-type non-linear regression user growth model. For the details, please see to "Are Bitcoin Bubbles Predictable? Combining a Generalized Metcalfel's Law and the LPPLS Mode"\n
        Arguably, the big drop of active addresses in early 2018 seems to have very limited affect on the major trend.
