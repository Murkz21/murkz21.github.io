### What Is SoftRepublic

It's a long story to tell...

### Who I Am

Try to reach me for some mindspark.

With rich RnD, PM, Sales and MKT experience, I am now getting back to basics of techologies, a [Python](http://www.python.org/) programmer for now. See also my [resume](https://murkz21.github.io/resume.html). I am [@MurkzWong](https://twitter.com/MurkzWong) on Twitter.

I am working on personal projects (and maybe some papers or a book in the future).

I have worked for a world-class telecommunication techology company for more than 13 years, and on my personal projects for quite a few years.

### My Name

**Pronunciation:** /ˈmɑːkəs/.
